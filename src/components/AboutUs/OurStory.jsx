            It all started in 2008, with a love for cars and a frustration with finding the right parts. We, the founders of AutoParts, are a group of gearheads who spent countless hours sifting through endless parts catalogs, often unsure of compatibility or overwhelmed by technical jargon. We knew there had to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is how AutoParts was born. Our vision is to make getting the perfect auto parts a smooth and empowering experience for everyone, from seasoned mechanics to weekend warriors.
